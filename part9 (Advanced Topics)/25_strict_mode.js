INFO: What is Strict Mode ?
Strict Mode is a way to opt into a restricted version of javascript. It prevents you from doing things that are error-prone or poorly supported, and throws more errors when you write bad code.
- Must appear at the top of a script or function
- Applies only to the code in that scope (global or function)
*/

// You enable it with:
"use strict";
