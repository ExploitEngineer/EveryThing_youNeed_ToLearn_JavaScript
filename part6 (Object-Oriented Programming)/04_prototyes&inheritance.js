/*
ðŸ”¹ 1. Prototypes and Inheritance
âœ… What is a Prototype?
Every JavaScript object has a hidden internal property [[Prototype]], which points to another object. That object is called its prototype.
    This is how inheritance works in JS â€” through the prototype chain.

ðŸ”„ Prototype Chain:
If a property or method is not found in an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches null.

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,

};

console.log(rabbit.jumps); // true (own property)
console.log(rabbit.eats); // true (inherited from animal)
// Here, rabbit inherits from animal using __proto__.

/*
ðŸ”§ Real Prototypes:
Modern way to get/set prototype:
*/
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototypeObj);

/*
ðŸ”¹ 2. Object.create()
âœ… What is it?
Object.create(proto) creates a new object and sets its prototype to the given object.
